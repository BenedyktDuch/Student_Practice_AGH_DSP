ADMM - Alternating Direction Method Of Multipliers
===========
In this repostiory I present final version of ADMM dereverberation 
algorithm, implemented during student pratice in DSP AGH team.

This solution was based on Narrowband Generalized dereverberation framework desribed in
Jukic, Ante, et al. "A general framework for incorporating time-frequency
domain sparsity in multichannel speech dereverberation."
Journal of the Audio Engineering Society 65.1/2 (2017): 17-30.

Python version was created by me in reference to Matlab implementation 
created by AGH.

The main goal of the practice was to write and add ADMM alogrithm to nara_wpe
implementation avaliable in here: https://github.com/fgnt/nara_wpe
